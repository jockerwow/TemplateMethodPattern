# NullObjectPattern

- Summary: Behavioral Design Pattern that uses a null object to represent the absence of an actual object, to avoid the need for null checking and prevent NullPointerExceptions.

- Logic: The Null Object Pattern involves creating a null object that conforms to the interface of the actual object it is replacing.

- Result: This results in a more robust and flexible codebase, as it eliminates the need for null checks and allows for a consistent interface between actual and null objects.

- The Project contains Two branches: 1- legacy: With legacy code to show the code without implementing the pattern 2- master: with the pattern applied.
